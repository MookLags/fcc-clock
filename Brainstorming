Lots of user stories here. The first ton are just making sure
I have the correct identifiers on the divs.

Create a component for the length controll and make sure to have two props for _ label and _ length (break or session) to serve as IDs for the divs/ps/whatever.
The up and down arrows too need IDs of #break/session-decrement and #break/session-increment. Maybe have prop of type and give these buttons an ID of #{type}-increment and #{type}-decrement to do it more dynamically. 

Create a component for the timer with a #timer-label, #time-left

Create a component for timer control with a #start-stop button and a #reset button.

states to keep track of whether it's a break or a session,
whether session is in progress to disable the buttons

when either timer hits zero, it needs to, depending on the state, reset to the time XX:00 as provided by break length or session length
